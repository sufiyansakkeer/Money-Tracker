# Flutter Local Notifications Fix

This guide will help you fix the "reference to bigLargeIcon is ambiguous" error in the Flutter Local Notifications plugin.

## The Issue

The error occurs because there are two `bigLargeIcon` methods in the `BigPictureStyle` class:
- `bigLargeIcon(Bitmap)`
- `bigLargeIcon(Icon)`

When `null` is passed to this method, the Java compiler cannot determine which method to call.

## The Fix

You need to modify the `FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.java` file in the Flutter Local Notifications plugin.

### Step 1: Locate the Plugin File

The file is located in your Pub cache directory:

**Windows:**
```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pub\Cache\hosted\pub.dev\flutter_local_notifications-16.3.3\android\src\main\java\com\dexterous\flutterlocalnotifications\FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.java
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```
~/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dev/flutter_local_notifications-16.3.3/android/src/main/java/com/dexterous/flutterlocalnotifications/FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.java
```

### Step 2: Edit the File

Find this line (around line 1033):
```java
bigPictureStyle.bigLargeIcon(null);
```

Change it to:
```java
bigPictureStyle.bigLargeIcon((Bitmap) null);
```

### Step 3: Rebuild Your App

After making this change, rebuild your app:

```
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Alternative: Update the Plugin

If a newer version of the plugin is available that fixes this issue, you can update your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_local_notifications: ^17.0.0  # Use the latest version
```

Then run:
```
flutter pub get
```

## Note

This is a temporary fix until the plugin is updated with an official fix. The issue has been reported and a fix has been merged into the main repository.
