# Architecture Issues and Future Steps

## Current Issues

During the conversion to a feature-based clean architecture, we encountered several issues:

1. **Type Conflicts Between Domain and Data Layers**:
   - The domain layer and data layer have conflicting enum types (CategoryType and TransactionType)
   - This causes type errors when trying to convert between domain entities and data models

2. **Hive Adapter Issues**:
   - The Hive adapters are tightly coupled to the existing model structure
   - Changes to the model structure require regenerating the adapters

3. **Circular Dependencies**:
   - Some components have circular dependencies that need to be resolved

## Recommended Approach

To resolve these issues, we recommend the following approach:

1. **Simplify the Architecture**:
   - Use a single set of models/entities across the application
   - Keep the feature-based organization but simplify the domain-data separation

2. **Gradual Migration**:
   - Migrate one feature at a time
   - Start with the core components and then move to the features
   - Test thoroughly after each migration step

3. **Refactor Hive Integration**:
   - Create a clean abstraction layer for data persistence
   - Decouple the domain models from the Hive implementation details

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Current Syntax Errors**:
   - Resolve the type conflicts between domain and data layers
   - Fix the Hive adapter issues

2. **Implement Core Components**:
   - Complete the error handling and result classes
   - Implement the dependency injection container

3. **Migrate Features**:
   - Start with the transactions feature
   - Then migrate the categories feature
   - Finally, migrate the profile feature

4. **Write Tests**:
   - Write unit tests for the domain layer
   - Write integration tests for the data layer
   - Write UI tests for the presentation layer

5. **Documentation**:
   - Update the architecture documentation
   - Add code comments for complex parts
   - Create a migration guide for future developers
